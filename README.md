Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

A.  Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project. 

Note: Your timeline does not need to reflect the exact amount of time you will spend on each activity. You may use any tool to create your timeline, including word processing software, a spreadsheet, project management software, presentation software, or another tool of your choice.

Note:  The file size limit for your submission cannot be more than 16 MB.  Files larger than 16 MB cannot not be accepted.


B.  Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island.” 


C.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website. 

Note: You can use any tool to create the wireframe, such as graphic creation/manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.


D.  Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

>1.  Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.

>2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.


E.  Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing.
