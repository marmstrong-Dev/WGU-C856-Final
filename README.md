# WGU-C856-Final
Performance Assesment for C856 (UX Design)


__You have been contacted by the local government of the small island of Taniti. Since the island’s economy relies heavily on tourism, the Tanitian government has developed a plan to increase the number of tourists who visit the island and its attractions. As part of this plan, they have hired you to design a tourism website.

__The Tanitian government has conducted a survey to gather information about current tourists. Their findings from this survey are shown in the “Survey Results” attachment. The government has also provided you with the attached “About the Island” document to better inform you about Taniti and its visitors.

__Taniti’s current website has an outdated look and feel. The page navigation is unclear. All the tourist information is jumbled together on a single page, and the site lacks booking information and links to each activity or option. The site is also not compatible with mobile devices.

__The Tanitian government would like you to spend no more than one month designing a new website that will increase tourism on the island of Taniti and provide a welcoming experience for prospective tourists.
